            <h3>Rome, the city of seven hills</h3>
            <p>
              According to legend, Rome was founded by Romulus on April 21, 753 BC, atop one of its famed seven hills, the Palatine. Over time, the city expanded across these hills—Palatine, Aventine, Capitoline, Quirinal, Viminal, Esquiline, and Caelian—each carrying its own share of Rome's storied history. It was these very hills that shaped ancient Rome’s development and served as the foundation of one of history’s greatest civilizations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, traces of ancient Rome remain. Beyond the impressive ruins of the Roman Forum, peaceful piazzas with charming cafés offer classic Italian treats like gelato and espresso, and renowned restaurants present the best of Italian cuisine. Wandering the seven hills, you can gaze upon the sprawling rooftops, the monumental domes, and, in the distance, the lush greenery of the surrounding countryside, all while feeling the city's timeless energy.

              Hi! My name is ALex and I've been visiting Rome for several
              years. I'm very fond of the city. I created this page as part of a
